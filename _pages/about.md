Hi, I'm Jifan!
I’m a third-year PhD student of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. I’m advised by Prof. [Miklos Racz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/). I received my B.S. in Mathmatics from Tsinghua University in 2021. 

Research Interest
------

I have a broad interest in random graph theory, including community detection, local neighbourhoods recovery, etc.  I study information-theoretic thresholds for community recovery and local neighbourhoods isomorphism problems and also design algorithms for graph matching and labelling.
