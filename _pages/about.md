Hi, I'm Jifan!
I’m a fourth-year PhD student of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. I’m advised by Prof. [Miklos Racz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Pure and applied mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2021, where I worked with Prof. [Qian Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/qianlincd/). 

Research Interest
------


I work at the intersection of statistics, combinatorics, and computer science, with a core focus on graph-structured data, both from a theoretical and applied perspective.

On the theoretical front, I develop and analyze probabilistic models for complex networks, such as the stochastic block model. My research tackles fundamental challenges like graph matching, community detection, and latent structure recovery. A key direction involves leveraging multiple correlated graphs to boost the reliability and accuracy of inference tasks, with growing relevance in multi-modal data integration and networked systems.

On the applied side, I designed machine learning solutions for real-world graph problems. I’ve developed uncertainty quantification methods for spatio-temporal graphs that offer rigorous coverage guarantees in high-dimensional spaces. I also explored how graph neural networks can be applied for causal representation learning from networked data. 

I’m passionate about graph-structured data as a powerful abstraction that underpins a wide range of domains. I’m excited by its potential to unify theory and practice and to drive intelligent, scalable solutions across diverse applications.
