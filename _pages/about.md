Hi, I'm Jifan!
I’m a fourth-year PhD student of Statistics and Data Science at Northwestern University. I’m advised by Prof. [Miklos Racz](https://racz.statistics.northwestern.edu/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathmatics from Tsinghua University in 2021, where I worked with Prof. [Qian Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/qianlincd/). 

Research Interest
------

My research interests lie primarily in network analysis and machine learning, encompassing both the theoretical analysis and the empirical application of graph models. My theoretical work predominantly focuses on various probabilistic generative graph models such as stochastic block model and related inference tasks including graph matching, community recovery and latent structure recovery.  Particularly, I am devoted to study multiple correlated networks and quantify the value of how incorporating additional graph information can help with graph inference tsks including graph matching and community recovery. 

Empirically, I studied  the causal disentanglement framework by integrating graph structures
 into the autoencoding variational
Bayes model, to improve the prediction of unseen combinatorial perturbation effects in genomics. I am also deeply interested in the forecasting for time series with spatial dependencies which, sometimes can be referred as spatio-temporal graphs. I have focused on studying  uncertainty quantification for spatio-temporal graphs by employing adaptive conformal prediction methodologies to enhance the reliability and efficiency of predictions.
